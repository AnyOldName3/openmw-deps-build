# openmw-deps-build

This is a repository to host CI jobs to build dependencies for OpenMW to be cached as binary artifacts at https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw-deps.
Jobs start automatically on push to master and automatically push archived artifacts to another git repository.

To make this work properly multiple [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) have to be configured:

* `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` with private SSH key allowed to push changes to repository specified via `PUSH_URL` variable (e.g. generated by `ssh-keygen`).
* `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` with private GPG key to sign commits with GPG signature (e.g. generated with `gpg --full-generate-key`).
* `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE` a passphrase for the `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` to make it possible to use the GPG key (e.g. the value used during `gpg --full-generate-key`).

Also following [variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables) have to be set:

* `PUSH_URL` with target SSH-based URL for `git push` command (e.g. `git@gitlab.com:OpenMW/openmw-deps.git`).
